## A little bit about me 💃
- :telescope: I’m currently working on TDD-ing the [same small kata project](https://github.com/sofyloafy/review4) in two [different testing styles](https://devlead.io/DevTips/LondonVsChicago).
- :seedling: I’m currently learning [React](https://react-tetris-3000.netlify.app/) and Kotlin
- :dancers: I’m looking to collaborate on a project that uses the MERN tech stack with large volumes of data
- :speech_balloon: Ask me about changing gears from a pastry chef at Ottlenghi to a software engineer, and how maybe they aren’t so different :cake:
